## Introduction
This project contains an easy-to-implement grid class. The custom grid will be pre-made before the project is run.

## Usage
The Grid class is under the grid.js file.

These properties can be changed:
- width
- height
- alpha
- data

These methods must be modified:
- refreshDataTiles()
Note: char refers to the symbols used in the data attribute

The img.js file must also be modified

Any part of the program is free to use, credit is encouraged
